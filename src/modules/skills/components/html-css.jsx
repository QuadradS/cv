                Knowledge of the semantics of tags and why to use it, since I
                wrote ssr for ready-made projects and had experience work
                with a seo specialist. In addition to semantics, I also worked
                with seo, in particular:
            </p>

                <li>- Implementing custom ssr for react</li>
                <li>- OG: tags</li>
                <li>- Canonical</li>
                <li>- Validation schema</li>
                <li>- Writing texts and tags for a seo robot</li>

                I constantly typeset and am not afraid of a complex crossbrowser adaptive layout; I have layout
                experience as well as
                with modern, convenient flexbox and grid, as well as with the
                dreaded float table and 'marvelous' layout. Always at work use
                modern tools for working with css in particular:
            </p>
        </Section>
    )
}

export default HtmlCss;
