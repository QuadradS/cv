                Extensive JavaScript experience from simple variables and
                loops to Proxy Promise AsyncAwait and more. I wrote quite a
                lot in native JavaScript, so I know DOM and BOM methods
                well, I also actively study new languages are standard and I try
                to use them in combat while waiting for the new operator '??',
                classes and so on.

                I also actively study algorithmic and big O notation, when there
                is an opportunity I try to bring everything algorithmic to
                execution speed O(nlogn)
